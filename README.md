Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, levels and trends in domestic revenues and external flows to developing economies were already considered insufficient to
support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). With high levels of public debt and additional pressures induced by the pandemic on all major sources of
development finance, low- and middle-income countries may struggle to finance their public health, social and economic responses to COVID-19.
This is an opportunity to refocus on sustainability and responsible investment. There is early evidence suggesting that sustainable investment strategies
continue to outperform the broader market in this crisis. Investors should incorporate COVID-19 in their stewardship activities, support their portfolio
companies in navigating the effects of this crisis and continue to focus on creating long-term value for their beneficiaries.
The pandemic has underscored the complexity and interconnectedness of our world – in terms of trade, commerce, as well as relationships between people
and societies – and how quickly these links can collapse if not sustainable. Sustainability risks must be understood as economic risk.
To analyze the financial trends and the impact of the pandemic on these trends, we have analyzed a few parameters which reflect the global financial situation comprehensively. 
One of the parameter is the Investments during the course of Pandemic within India and collectively across the globe.
